Katana - The Game Engine

The master branch is currently empty. See develop branch for ongoing development.

## New development starting soon

The current development is soon to be discontinued and is to be replaced by completely redesigned engine.

The new engine will be based on **Entity-Component-System** allowing the engine to be real flexible in terms of its capabilities. See the following project for the inspiration of the new system.
